# Class 4: Pandas

Today we will:

+++
## Remember, Programming is a Practice

- if you're curious about something try it
- you don't need me to give you answers about how code works, the interpreter will tell you
- if you don't remember details, remember you can get help from Jupyter

with a `?` after the function name withouth `()`
```{code-cell} ipython3
print?
```

or using the `tab` key inside the `()` for a function
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["raises-exception","remove-output"]
print()
```

or from the core python, with the `help` fucntion
```{code-cell} ipython3
help(print)
```

## Data in Pandas

We can import `pandas` again as before
```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

and we can read in data.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brownsarahm/python-socialsci-files/master/data/SAFI_clean.csv')
```

to be able to use this, we need to save it to a variable.
```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brownsarahm/python-socialsci-files/master/data/SAFI_clean.csv')
```

This is an excerpt from the [SAFI dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/SAFI_Survey_Results/6262019).

Another important thing to do is to check datatypes, this is how we know what things we can do with a variable.

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(safi_df)
```

````{margin}
```{tip}
we can also see the size when we print the whole dataset as in the first time we read the data in.
```
````
An important thing to check is the size of the dataset.

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.shape
```

Recall that you can also tab complete
```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.shape
```

To see the first 5 rows of the dataset, use the `head()` function
```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.head()
```

We can call this function with a value to change how many rows are returned

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.head(3)
```

To know how this works, we can view the documentation for the function
````{margin}
```{warning}
this was changed from using `?` for help in class so that the help is desplayed in the rendered website, but the pop up was fine in real time
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(safi_df.head)
```
Since it says `n =5` we know that the default value of the parameter `n` is 5. When a function has a default value, we can call the function without a value.

To view the last few lines, we use `tail`

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.tail()
```

We can also get an `Index` for the columns of the DataFrame.
```{margin}
[`Index`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Index.html) is another data type that is defined by `pandas`.
```
```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.columns
```

an `Index` variable is iterable so we can index into it
```{admonition} Try it Yourself
How would you view the name of the 3rd column?
```

First the correct answer:
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]

safi_df.columns[2]
```

Now some misconceptions:


```{code-cell} ipython3

safi_df['interview_date']
```
Indexing with the column name) will return the *values* in the column

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["raises-exception"]

safi_df.columns(2)
```
Using `()` returns an error, because `columns` is a *property* which is referenced as is with no `()`. We get a type error  because functions in python are objects of type `callable` and properties are values not functions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["raises-exception"]

pd.DataFrame.columns[2]
```

This doesn't work because `columns` is a property of an object of type `pandas.DataFrame` not a property of the `type`

We can see what the type of pd.DataFrame is with the `type` function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(pd.DataFrame)
```

Knowing about types is helpful for the individual columns of a dataset as well.


```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.dtypes
```

Note that it uses `int64` and `object` as the types.

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.head(2)
```

We might want to look at what villages were included in the data.

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.unique(safi_df['village'])
```


We can also get  count of the number of of each value

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df['village'].value_counts()
```

````{admonition} Try it Yourself!
how many surveyed farms have all type `mauddaub`?


```{toggle}
46 or 45 count as good answers.
```

````

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input","hide-output"]
safi_df['respondent_wall_type'].value_counts()
```
