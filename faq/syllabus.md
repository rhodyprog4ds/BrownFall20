## Syllabus FAQ


_How much does assignment x, class participation, or a portfolio check weigh in my grade?_
```{toggle}
There is no specific weight for any activities, because your grade is based on earning achievements for the skills listed in the [skills rubric](skill-rubric).

However, if you do not submit (or earn no achievements from) assignments or portfolios, the maximum grade you can earn is a C.
If you do not submit (or earn no achievements from) your portfolio, the maximum grade you can earn is a B.

_Can I submit this assignment late if ...?_
```{toggle}
No, late assignments are not accepted. Your grade is based on the skills, not the assignments. All skills are assessed in at least two [assignments](assignment-skills), so missing any one will not hurt your grade.
